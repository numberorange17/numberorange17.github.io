    <td>  I think that I do need to work on my Blog as I am still trying to fix it and I am having trouble posting this one as I made a bad mistake whilst coding and cannot fix it. I need to now stop glancing over when my partner is reading the instructions or think up a new strategy to stop this from happening.

    <td>I think that to solve my issue, we need to read the instructions ourselves and code whilst the other one of us is checking for mistakes, and then we would swap over. Hopefully this is a good way to code. I also hope to carry on working on my blog because of last weeks incident. </td>
