IT Lesson 22/09/16

Today we carried on with the 'FUZE' computer programmer and my partner and I managed to complete three exercises whist saving them all onto a memory stick. This Lesson went well.

Last Lesson Target: My Target from Last Lesson was to get the computer running in under a minute and we managed to do that with previous experience of doing it in other Lessons. We could get on to the code straight away.

WWW: I think that We managed to get the computer on quickly and we managed to get to exercise four.

EBI: I think It would have been better if one of us read the instructions to the other as when we took turns we did it all by ourselves.

Next Lesson: Next Lesson I think we will be doing the same so my target would be to both work on it at the same time.

Overall, I think that today went well but there is room for improvement next week.
