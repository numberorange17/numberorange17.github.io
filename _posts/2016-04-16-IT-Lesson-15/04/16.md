IT Lesson 15/04/16

I think that Today was a very good and interesting lesson, as I learned lots of new things about prezi.

WWW: I think that Today I understood it all and for the homework I found my partner's website, meaning that I could successfully complete the homework without asking him the name again.

EBI: I think that this would have been better if I would have done my prezi better as there was a lot of grammar mistakes that  I had to change for homework. Some other prezis were really good.

Overall I enjoyed seeing other people's prezis and it was a good lesson.
