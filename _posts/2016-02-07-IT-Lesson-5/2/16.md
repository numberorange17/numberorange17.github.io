IT Lesson 5/2/15

Today we did even more on the media, meaning that we looked at a really annoying twitter advertisement and our homework was to complete an interview on a family member on their use of  social media.

WWW: I think that this whole lesson went well for me as we had to listen to MR Keen about the media and how twitter do stuff like tweets.

EBI: I think that this would have been better without the annoying twitter advertisement/opera , otherwise, I think that this lesson went really well with lots of interesting facts about social media.
