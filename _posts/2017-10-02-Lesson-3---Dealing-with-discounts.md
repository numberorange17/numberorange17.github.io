Lesson 3 - Dealing with discounts

Today, we focused on cleaning up what we have already. This is the overall delivery cost and the discount. The discount was the one we struggled with due to the complexity of making a whole other discount sheet, which would determine whether or not a code was valid, and all the available codes.

We also had to make sure that where we did not have an item, the computer responded *'#NA' *, this was hard because we had to use such terms as ‘ISERROR’. This would alert the computer to the error for a change.

Personally, I think I coped with the challenge on Google sheets well, my target for next lesson is to focus more and more, continuing to attempt many possibilities of the right answer before either giving up, or jumping to conclusion.

Google sheets so far is a programme that it very useful for quick mathematics (it can do a lot of sums in a short space of time), and it is good at making impressive order forms or stock lists for a shop.

Although I struggle a bit with a few terms, I think that google sheets is interesting, and in a way, enjoyable too.
