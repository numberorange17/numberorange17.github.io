Lesson 2 Continuing with the turtles 

Today, we continued with what we did last lesson, this was coding with turtles in python. After getting it to draw simple shapes last week, this week, we relied on more code and angles to do it this time. With the turtles starting to draw our names. I learnt the code "penup" which means the turtle will stop writing until you use the “pendown” code. 

I improved on what I knew last lesson with more understanding of the code. 

Next lesson, unlike this lesson, I would like to get more work completed, meaning I have to think, type and calculate the angles more quickly and efficiently.
