In this lesson, the aim was to continue with what we had done in our last lesson, So my personal aim was to fix my quiz. Which I had mentioned last blog, that it had broken. I managed to get this completed in good time, therefore I had just less than half the lesson left to do something else. In this time, I decided that I would change the topic of my blog. This could have easily gone wrong for me. I changed the quiz from guessing what dog breed you would be, to one that would estimate the age you will live up to. Personally I see a big improvement as it is something that is more interesting, useful and formal than my previous idea.

I think that I worked well this lesson and that I am pleased with the work I got done. Next lesson, unless we are starting something else, I have heard about an extension sort of thing, as I think that my quiz is ready.

On another note, I am still unaware of the Markdown to Kramdown change as mentioned before. At the moment, it seems to be working fine and fully functional, so I will leave it as it is unless it breaks or we get told how to change it ever in the lesson (I have tried it and it says blog is working properly, but when I tried to post something, unfortunately it did not work).
