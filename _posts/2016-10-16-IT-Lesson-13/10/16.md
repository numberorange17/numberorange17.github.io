    <td>To complete this exercise as it is a long one, and work as quickly as last week. </td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, we worked quickly and managed to complete ex 5.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I improved on my coding as we coded a mini moving alien on the screen and managed to save it, unlike last lesson when we thought we had but we actually didn't. I also worked well with my partner well with a useful strategy which was a good way for taking turns. This went well. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that we need to be certain on what we are doing as there is room for progress for example we need to know exactly where our work is saved as we do not fully understand where it is.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I think that we will try lots of different ways to save our work, otherwise we will do exactly as we did this time as my partner and I worked well together and I think that we did it pretty quickly.</td>
  </tr>
