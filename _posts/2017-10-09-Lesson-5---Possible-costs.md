Lesson 5 - Possible costs                                              9/10/17

Today we were looking up all the possible costs for the kompany for example the cost for all the utilities taxes (water, electric and gas ), we also thought about rent for a building, income and transportation fees or even advertisment.

THe main one we looked a today though was the Pay Roll, we created a new sheet, looking on how their job affects their salary, or their experience.

We also looked at how you would include the sheet to a blog.

I found that I could cope with the main task of the lesson quite well, understanding the key points and including extra detail. I did struggle a lot though with including the sheet to the blog although this seemed and was meant to be quite simple.

Next lesson, I hope I can include everything required, along with understanding it well, to the extent necessary. 

Next lesson is the last lesson on sheets, this means there will be a difficult climax, within which I hope to complete the work efficiently and correctly.
