Lesson 6 Cryptography

Today we looked at cryptography, which is basically language that you are basically personalising by turning it into code

e.g : Original: STAR

        Cryptography: TUBS

This is because we are moving the alphabet to the right one space.

 

The 'Wikipedia' definition of cryptography:

'Cryptography or cryptology is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages'.

In the lesson today we bought our findings of cryptography onto google spreadsheets.

I found this hard, we had to use almost all of our previous skills on spreadsheets here.

We Basically wrote out our whole new cyber alphabet and from here using VLOOKUP,

We turned words into codes.

I really struggled here because we then looked at LEFT and RIGHT to put into our sheets from homework, this is when I struggled and got lost, i have done what I can for homework but i do not think it is correct. 

Foe next lesson to improve, I hope I can take notes throughout. This will hopefully prove useful.
