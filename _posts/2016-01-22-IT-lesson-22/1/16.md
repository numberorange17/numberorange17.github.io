IT lesson 22/1/16

Today we did another lesson looking at media and how it changes us. We saw that other people's decisions changed our own opinions on things such as '' Do you prefer text to Phone?’’ .

WWW: I think that i did understand the lesson and the videos and i did get along wit it pretty well.

EBI: I think that I could have done better If I would have kept my own opinion and not changing, just because other people have different opinions.
