Today, it was the same format lesson to those that we have been doing for the past few weeks, in that we are continuing with our quizzes. Coming in to the lesson, I was questioning to myself whether I thought I had finished my work. I thought that everything was  alright coming into the lesson as it gave a correct answer every time, except once. This time, I put the response '32' to one of the questions. This meant that the overall answer would be incorrect. This did not make sense a some other code I had written said:

if V1<"4":

	ref1=1

  else:

	print(random.choice(wrong1))

This did not seem to work though. It was the same for any multiple digit integer sarting in the number '1',’2’, or ‘3’. This meant that I had to correct this mistake. This took me most of the lesson but I managed to get it done in the end.

Next lesson I will triple check my code and then move on to an extension afterwards. I think I worked well today though because I got all the work necessary, completed, but next time I hope to work at a quicker pace to insure more work gets completed in the time available.
