IT Lesson 6/05/16

 

I think that today was a really successful lesson as we got to learn lots of tutorials meaning that we could understand bbc micro-bit a bit better.

WWW: I think that the lesson went well as I learned lots and lots about these micro-bit tutorials and I also started to enjoy year 7 IT a lot more than I used to!

EBI: I think it would have been better if I would have done more than one tutorial in the lesson.

I think that overall today was a really good and successful lesson.
