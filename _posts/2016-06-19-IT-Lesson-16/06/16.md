IT Lesson 16/06/16

I think that today went  quite well. Today we started off by looking at the homework to see who managed to get it right and who managed to get it wrong. I had to change mine a bit. This was also the day when we actually started to make our games already planned, on BBC Micro-bit

WWW: I did not struggle too badly with my code and I managed to do everything in the lesson.

EBI: this would have been better If I did last week's homework better and if I managed to be ok with the homework.

Overall, I think that today went well.
