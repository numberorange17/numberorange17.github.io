Lesson 1 Starting Python

After a 10 week break from IT, we got started with it again, but this time with a different topic. Today we started learning coding, to some extent it was revision from what we had learned from the topic, before, I think that I coped well with the task. And got everything required, correct.

It was Python coding (with turtle) -  this let us code into a turtle. We added in shortcuts to the code as well. The aim today, was making the turtle draw shapes. It was interesting to see how much I could remember. Here is the code we used today:

import turtle

turtle.shape("turtle")

turtle speed(3)

sides = 4

length = 100

for number in range(sides):

turtle.forward(length)

turtle.left(360/sides)

*This example is for a square*

I coped well with it, and for next lesson I hope to understand whatever we will be set. It will probably additional work to the code or something new in this topic.

I hope I will work as hard as I did today as it helped me a lot in the lesson.
