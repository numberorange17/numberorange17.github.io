  <tr>
    <td>My partner and I kept on swapping around the roles of who will read the instructions and who will do the coding. This would go around each time for around 5 minutes.
Today we both did more work then we each thought we would do. (we completed the exercise twice!)

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Today there was a big mistake in the work that was completed with my partner, we had to do the same exercise again as the first one would not save not only did this happen, but when we tried to run it after doing it all over again, it got deleted, I will do my research to see what went wrong.
I hope this does not happen again.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, hopefully my partner and I will get our work running but we learned  from our mistakes.
Next Lesson I hope to do the same typing turns as it really worked for speed and accuracy over the project. I hope to start number 5 for next lesson.</td>
