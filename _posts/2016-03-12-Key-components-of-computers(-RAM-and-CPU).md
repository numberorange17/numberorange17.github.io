**Key components of computers( RAM and CPU)**

The main components of a computer:

OUTPUTS:    Scanner 

INPUTS:        Printer

Motherboard

CPU

RAM

ROM

Fans

Hard Drive

The Motherboard is the bit of the computer where it accommodates all of the other main points such as the CPU and the RAM. THere are lots of other main and key parts of the motherboard.

CPU stands for central processing unit. In terms of computer power,the CPU is the most important element of the whole computer power.

RAM stands for the random accessing Memory.

                                         **INTERNET SECURITY**

MAILWEAR:

Malware is the thing that describes lots of programs and try to do something that is unwanted to the computer. Mailwear is a bad thing that attacks your device

VIRUSES:

Viruses are that things that you get on your computer if you do not have anti virus software such as McAfee.

WORM:

These worms copy themselves over onto other computers, meaning that they are really bad and hard to get rid of. Once these worms have doubled once, they will copy again and again.This is bad.

TROJAN:

At first, a trojan pretends to be a good  file but will give unauthorised access to the computer when someone runs it. This is where slowly the file abandons you and becomes something that is hard to delete.

ZOMBIENET/ BOTNET:

This is where the computers connect to each other and these are the bits where they slowly attack your device and this is where your devices could get viruses.the zombienet or the botnet is  literally the process where all of the bad stuff slowly gets transferred through different computers.
