IT Lesson 29/04/16

Today we did more on the micro-bit website on the BBC. Today it was about creating code for a new sorting hat mini-game like the one in Harry potter but instead of being magical, it was mechanical.

WWW: I think that most things went well today, such as me understanding the code to be used.

EBI: It would have been better if I would have understood the homework or tried completing it in the lesson instead.

 

Overall, today was a really good useful lesson.
