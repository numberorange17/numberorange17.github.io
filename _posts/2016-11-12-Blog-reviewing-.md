    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>My blog/website has its problems and we had to hand in the links         to the blogs. My one is not that good.
</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td> For this Lesson and homework I need to think of ideas on how to            fix it.
</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, although I am still working on It I think that I have reached my target.</td>

    <td>
I thought that Mr Keen showing my blog up on the board and criticising it helped me because it showed me what to improve or change on my blog at the moment. It lead me into a direction, I also found that thinking up different strategies helped me.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that my blog should have been more correct before it was shown on the board. If we are doing the Fuze project again, I need to bring on my target from last lesson to next Lesson to help me</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that doing a few alterations every week will help my blog and I will work with my partner more if we are doing the 'FUZE' project next week by sharing around the jobs. </td>
