Year 9 Lesson 1 Intro to Spreadsheets

In this lesson, we had an introduction to google spreadsheets. We were shown how we were to present and layout data in this programme.

Using terms like 'vlookup' we had to make a stock list for a shop and an order form on two different sheets. In the end, you just needed to type the item code and the quantity, and then it would show you the name of the item, the price of the one item, and total price.

In this lesson, I think I succeeded in my learning, managing to master a few new skills I hadn't heard of, Although I did struggle on deleting some table, but only briefly. For next time, I aim to work quicker so I can learn more in less time.

All, in all, I think i did well in this lesson and hope to keep it up for next week.
