YEAR  8 IT

I have enjoyed this year doing IT.

In the first term, we were working on the FUZE Box.

This was an exciting set of exercises we used off a small booklet on the coding instructions. The code showed us how to code properly on a computer, and understand this. This helped us start Codecademy later with more knowledge.

As we progressed into the FUZE Box project, we started to add or put in more interesting aspects, such as lights.

The lights, tested our skills  on understanding the computer, because we needed to put the lights in exactly the right place, or the lights would not turn on when they were supposed to and it would be a mess. This was testing us.

Although we only had one lesson of the Robot arm, it was still an excellent opportunity and it helped me learn and understand this well.

Around this time in the year, we also had a blog assessment. Although my  blog was considered 'bad', I managed to work on from this point and learn from there.

 After that, we did lesson after lesson on Codecademy.

Although I found it a bit repetitive, I did learn lots more about coding from it.
