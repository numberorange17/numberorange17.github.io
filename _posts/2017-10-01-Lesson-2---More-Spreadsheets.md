Lesson 2 - More Spreadsheets

Today, we continued work on google spreadsheets, the main part of the day was finding out about how to get a grand-total from a sub-total. 

We added in the VAT and the discounts. The discounts was what I struggled with most though. We had to make a number of discount codes that could be typed in, therefore you could save money.

We also added in a delivery for homework which would depend on the overall cost.

I worked well in the lesson although I did not finish I discounts, I find that working on google spreadsheets is a challenge, but next week I think I will be more used to it as it will get harder.
