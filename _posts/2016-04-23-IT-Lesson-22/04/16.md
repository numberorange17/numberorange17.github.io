IT Lesson 22/04/16

Today we learnt more about coding with this new thing on the bbc. It was about something that was a small computer chip and made games and stuff if you used the right code. It was good and fun.

WWW: I think that this lesson went really well because we used it to understand this new piece of equipment. I managed to make lots of new mini games on the tutorials and did one thing by myself.

EBI: At the end I made a mistake and said to wait 100 milliseconds before it goes on to the next one. This was too quick.

Today went really well as I learned lots of new things about this chip but it would have been better if i had remembered its name!
