IT Lesson 14/07/16

 

Today we learnt about lots of propaganda on the internet such as news channels like BBC. We got some homework on this. It was to watch different news channels for propaganda.

WWW: I understood what was going on and could give a good description on what propaganda actually is.

EBI: There is always more things I could have picked up and remembered about the last lesson of the year.

On these news pages I saw that BBC contained more propaganda:

[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news)

[http://america.aljazeera.com/](http://america.aljazeera.com/)

I think that today went well as I learnt a new thing.
