IT LESSON 9/06/16

Today we were introduced to the fact that we had to do this new BBC Micro-Bit game using all of the present coding knowledge in our brains to code a game that will be graded on. Today we had to plan this new game using a new website called Lucidchart. This shows your ideas clearly.

WWW: I Think that the lesson got me to understanding Lucidchart so I could do my homework.

EBI: I was working at quite a slow pace in the lesson so y target for next lesson would to work quicker.

Overall today went well.
