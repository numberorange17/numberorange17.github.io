    <td>I learnt in the lesson by using different strategies in my work. I was  on the same question for the entire lesson but finished more for Homework. Although this occurred, I did learn from the mistake and I think that helps. I found that this was important as I help me understand the question in the lesson.</td>

    <td>I think that my learning was limited by the fact that I did not complete much work in the lesson. This resulted in me not understanding as much and I need to work on this.</td>
