Lesson 3 Colour

Today we continued with turtle, where we are putting into practice, writing our names, you need to be good at calculating angles, lengths and checking for any errors. I feel that I am fairly confident with these techniques, although there are a few bits in this that can be hard, for example creating the letter "m" it is hard to use the semi-circles correctly. This is something I have personally struggled with.

Today, we started to add colour into our designs, to some extent this was easy, but when it went wrong it was hard to fix.

I think that I understood and did every task to the best of my ability, whilst I think that my turtle animation looks pretty good. Next week I hope to work out how to do the letter "m", and to continue from where I left off today.
