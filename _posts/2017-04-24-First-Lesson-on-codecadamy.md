(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

I feel I did reach my target though.</td>

</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I managed to understand from Mr Keen that asking questions to other people to improve your work, would not necessarily improve your learning. I successfully did this well and when I got stuck, I just carried on, which was the best thing to do at that moment because It did help me understand the task so I could completely understand it when I was finishing the task off for homework.  </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? 
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think I was not working at a fast enough pace because there were some tricky tasks to complete so I think I will need to work on this over the project.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To improve my learning for next time by managing to work at a quicker rate. Although codecademy gets a lot harder, I think I will manage my target as overtime I will understand the whole programme and code itself a lot more which will help me.</td>
