IT Lesson 13/05/16

Today was a bit like last lesson as for the whole lesson, we carried on doing the tutorials on the bbc micro-bit website.

WWW: I think that the good thing about this lesson for me was not getting stuck at all until the end, this means that I understood all of what I was supposed to. This is quite good actually.

EBI: I think that it would have been better if I would have not got stuck at the end so I could do the homework.

Overall, I think this lesson went well!
