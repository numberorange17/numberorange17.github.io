Lesson 5 Final presentation

Today, we looked at what the final spreadsheet would need to include if we were to hand it in through google classroom. 

One of the things I had to include is P & L Which is profit and loss. This is one of the most important sheets on this project as it reveals the  Profit and Loss. The loss would be the amount of items you are selling multiplied by the overall price you would be selling them at.

Another loss would be such things as Bills, taxes and Rent this all had to be included. The profit was the items sold (which was vastly more in my example due to overpricing). The total profit is your profit minus the Loss.

Another thing we had to do, was add the Google sheet to the web. This is basically quite simple as you need to embed your sheet to the web. This will give you a code that all you need to do is place it your blog. 

Overall I think the lesson was good as I fully understood what I was doing. Although I think we are doing another topic next lesson, to improve, my target for this is to every now and again, go onto spreadsheets to make sure I can remember all of the different key learning points of the topic.

My Spreadsheet is embedded below.
