IT Lesson 29/1/15

Today we looked at more media Literacy and stuff like that, by doing that, we looked up on which things in the media are good and most things in the media are bad, a bad reason is that you can send fake pictures of yourself and you can pretend to be a person that you not actually are, and this can lead to bad things such as child pawn and lots of nasty and unpleasant things which are a bit like that .

WWW: I think that everything went well andIi answered some questions about the good and bad media examples.

EBI: I think that I would have been a bit better if my computer would have turned off properly at the end.
