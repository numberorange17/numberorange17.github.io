Today, I realised that my quiz was certainly finished, therefore it meant that there was still some checking to do. This is because last week I found out this was the case. Once I had checked it, I could not find any, therefore I realised that I had been working on my repl.it quiz for long enough.

This meant that I could start something else to do in the lesson. I started to explore the app scratch. On scratch, I did was explore and discover the app, making a scene where I got controlled movement of sprites.

Next lesson, I may try another IT app, however, I seems to be too different to have a target for the next lesson.

(In next lesson I continue with scratch and what I have mentioned above here.)
This was my last ever IT Lesson and therefore my last ever blog.
