 Reach the next task, python lists and dictionaries - 38% </td>

    <td>Lesson Review
The lesson went really well and In the end I did manage to learn quite a lot about about a real life situation, I managed to learn a bit about python lists and dictionaries and I managed to reach my target.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by making mistakes and just re-reading the question a lot for a while and looking at my code for the problems and errors until I would get it right.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I found that working by myself really is quite hard as lots of people around me are talking often so it is distracting. I need to work on focusing on my own work a bit more. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I hope to work on the things mentioned above and try to learn more on python lists and dictionaries.</td>
  </tr>
