In this lesson we were supposed to continue with the same quiz. This is our final piece of IT work that we will actually have to do before we stop it all together. This is what it is so important for it to be good.

Unfortunately, when I turned mine on at repl.it, I tried running it, but it did not seem to work and claimed that there were a few errors in it. When I looked at the code, everything seemed to be messed up. Therefore, I had to do something about it. I remain with no clue about how this may have occurred, but the whole lesson I was sat there fixing it. Although I am not to pleased about it, I am happy with the amount of work I got done in the time available, leaving only a small amount of fixing to do next lesson. I hope to have enough time next lesson to manage to change the topic of my quiz.

On another note, I have done a change to Kramdown from Markdown (see previous blog) but I am not fully sure it is working. If not, I will need to check it next lesson.
