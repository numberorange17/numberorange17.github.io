Lesson 5 Quiz Code

Today we continued with turtle python code. But we explored different aspects of the coding bit on the console tab. Unlike last week, this week we looked at quizzes on the internet and wondered about the code that would be used in them. I made mine about dog breeds, a random topic. It worked out well, with the outcome being the computer asking pre-written questions, with you choosing an option. The options you choose will add up and tell you something made up about yourself. To make this even more realistic, the computer would refer back to one of your answers to communicate with you. This would be done by calling your answer a name and then referring back to it. We also stopped people entering incorrect answers, by basically saying that  if  the answer was greater than three or less than one, it would come up with a string saying you have done wrong, and then ask you the question again.

I think that I was successful with the task as I got it operating as well as having a couple of extras, for example, referring back to even more questions. I am also glad that I fully understand this type of coding and am quite confident about everything that we have covered today. For next time though, although it may be a different task, I would like to include a lot more extra in my work, in even less time, because today I noticed that the work took me more time than I had anticipated at the start.

Overall, I think I understand this quite well, and it was quite good to really know how these types of quizzes really work, and how in real life, they are probably really unrealistic and incorrect.

This was inspired by buzzfeed quizzes, which is an example of what I did today:
