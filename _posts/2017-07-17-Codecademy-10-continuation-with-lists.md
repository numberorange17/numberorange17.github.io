    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I found, that I learned by working hard on the shopping list exercise by using common sense.
A lot of the time in Codecademy, I have found myself over complicating things when the answer is much simpler. Having that in mind today, I feel that I worked better.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I feel that my learning was limited by the thought to give up due to the complicity of the exercises.
I will work on, looking closely for the answer and trying to stay focused, not giving up.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I hope I will manage to complete more in the lesson using the targets above, and hope to reach 50% as it is my last lesson.</td>
  </tr>
