ICT LESSON 11/12/15

I think that today went pretty well as I managed to do everything right and nothing wrong which was really good.

Today I think that my achievements were managing to understand the code a tiny bit more and to help this I managed to change the colour of the main screen and I did the same with the text

WWW: I managed to get the colour on and I also managed to fix my problem on publishing documents

EBI: I think that it would have been better if I could fix my publishing by myself but otherwise it was good.

This was probably my best IT lesson yet.
