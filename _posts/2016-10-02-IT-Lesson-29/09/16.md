    <td>It was goods to change the colour of the main background using this website where it would let you see what colours would work together. Originally, I had a green and black background. The I changed It to a blue and Black. The same website had the code for the colour, so I could just put it into my blog. I also went on my blog to see if it was working and it was. This was good.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that my slow working limited my learning as changing the background and listening to instructions was all I could manage in the lesson. This meant that I could not get onto the 'FUZE' project that we are working on and I could not have a go a the target I set myself last lesson.</td>

    <td>Next time we will be carrying on with the ‘FUZE’ project and I hope to work a lot quicker than I did today.</td>
