    <td>We got this done very quickly today and I think that I completed my target for last Lesson, which was to work quicker. I realised that my partner was helping a lot more than last week which definitely affected how quickly we worked and helped us learn at the same time. Today was really good.

  <tr>
    <td>I think that although I worked really well, I could not learn much as my partner was especially trying to get onto the robot arm for this lesson which we did. Because of this I really struggled to understand what we were coding for the third and final exercise for 'It's an analogue world'
Otherwise today was one of the best lessons I have had.

  <tr>
    <td>I think that firstly for next lesson I need to understand my code as I have struggled with this. I might have a test next lesson on this so I really should keep focused. When my partner and I did manage to get onto the robot arm, we did not actually make it work. I suppose we were in a rush but just to be sure, for next lesson I think we should focus on this a bit to improve our learning in general.</td>
