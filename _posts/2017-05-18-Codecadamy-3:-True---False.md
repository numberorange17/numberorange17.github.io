    <td>The way I learned Today, was firstly not getting distracted because of the distractions around me. I then realised that I could do it if I concentrated more.
Today we were learning about "True" and “False” in code. There was one particular exercise I struggled with so I learnt from that.

    <td>I think that the limit to my learning is the point  mentioned above, emphasising that i will easily get distracted from my work. To work on this I will take one moment to breath, and then I will try and restart and read the question again.
