IT Lesson 30/6/16

Today was a good lesson as we finally got our micro-bits. This was good because we managed to code stuff on them. This was our micro-bit games although mine is not finished yet.

WWW: I managed to get my micro- bit working and understand the talk on internet safety we had.

EBI: Today it took me a long time to pick up / understand the main lesson factors as I just understood the talk at the end.
