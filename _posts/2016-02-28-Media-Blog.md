To create my identity map, I think was quite hard because I  knew that I should not too much information on there otherwise it will be saying too much about yourself on the internet but if I would have done too little of an amount I would have had a bad grade. I thought it was quite hard to design an identity map about yourself, especially on A3 paper so you have to  decorate it more.

I thought it was ok to share my identity map with the class this way because I knew that I had not done a terrible Job and it was and it was also a chance where everybody in the class could know you a bit better as we have been in the class for over half of the year now. Good idea.

I thought that it was a good idea to comment on each other's identity map as we could see our opinions on each other's work. The thing that went wrong with this was the way some people commented on your work. These were nasty but most of them were about everyone disliking the football team you have chosen to support and have been supporting your whole life.

I think it might have been  a bit better if we commented directly to the student as it would have been way quicker and you would have been to understand them in lots more detail about your work.

I thought it was quite excited about reading through my comment but I was a bit surprised about one of my nasty comments where it said that it was a really bad piece of work and that it was nowhere near reaching national standards and with a sad face and that it said tut tut tut at the end.

This process is different compared to commenting online because you do not actually know who the person online is and what they look like, if not, you could not see them in the same room as you.

In a way it made me want to post less in the future because I would not want to get some of those nasty comments online because then I would take it too seriously and I would be really upset.

I think that there would be lots of changes that I would make in this media that I based on this activity.

These six lessons did probably change how I viewed social media because I found out that social media is way more terrifying than it is when you have not heard of it and you are starting to learn about it.

These lessons changed how I thought I would use social media in the future because In these six lessons, I found out that social media is way more dangerous than it actually is.
