Lesson 7 Original and Cyber messages

13/11/17

Today we continued from what we were doing last lesson. What we had initially aimed for the lesson was to complete the work so that you could type in a cyber text and it would come up with the original, and we also needed it the you can type in the original text and you would get the cyber text out on the other side. I did manage to fulfil my target after about 15 minutes of homework after the Lesson.

I think that today was a big improvement on last lesson, as firstly, last lesson I did not understand the task well at all.

I think that I worked well independently today and the things I could do best was using ' ISERROR' and clearly formatting using appropriate colour and also tables.

Next lesson is our last lesson so I think we will continue, in that case, I believe that I should firstly continue in the same type of way I am working in, and secondly, make notes on what is said, as I can forget important words or tasks.
