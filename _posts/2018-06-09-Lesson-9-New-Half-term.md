In this lesson we were in a new class for the first time in just less than 2 years. I am now in a new class with people that have not yet completed their quizzes, therefore we all added improvements. For example: Mine does not accept it if you put the wrong string in and then it comes up with a string telling you to try again. 

In the lesson today, I do not think I personally struggled with the work, whilst others, who were behind may have seen this in a different way. I am quite happy with the functioning of my quiz and think it is  quite good and effective, therefore I have not targets for next lesson in which I think that we will be continuing with it.

On another note, on the same day, I received an email from github. This was telling me that I could no longer use markdown and had to use another thing called kramdown. I presume this will really affect my understanding in github, and that thins piece will be fairly late, however it may not. I would like to find more about this and an update will be given as soon as possible.
