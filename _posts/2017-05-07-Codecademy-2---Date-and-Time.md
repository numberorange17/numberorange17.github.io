    <td>I learnt that my method last week (see target from previous blog) worked, as I put it a lot in my lesson today and it helped me reach my target for today. I used it a lot whilst coding. Today I thought that spending a lot more time on each question did help me. This helped me get a fair amount done correctly.</td>

    <td>I think I still have a small feeling of giving up on a hard code question. I should not think this because there are only small mistakes I make and have to correct</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For next time, I do hope to read the example and the main instructions again and think it over more carefully so I will hopefully spot the mistake and then correct it. Next lesson I also hope to complete more work. Although the tasks are getting a lot harder, as I said last week I think I will complete them quicker as I know a lot more about the programme. Today I was learning to tell the date and time in code and think that well. For next time I will have to change the way I am working as I believe in will be a lot harder.</td>
