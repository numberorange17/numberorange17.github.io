    <td>I feel that today I found that I worked with my partner really well as I did all of the coding and a bit of the lights while he checked the code and also did a bit of the lights. I also found the lights easier than last week but they were still really hard as you could not really see the small holes on the book, showing you where to actually attach the lights and wires to the computer. I think that I worked well though

    <td>I think that the lights and getting the wires in the right places caused me and my partner a few problems with time. Otherwise I think a worked really well.  </td>

    <td>I think that this lesson went well and next week we might get to the robot arm! My main target for next week is to work like this week and I think I need to focus on where to attach the lights to the 'FUZE Box' so that I can work a lot quicker along with my partner next week. </td>
