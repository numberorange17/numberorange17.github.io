Lesson 7 Finishing the Quiz

In today's lesson we just carried on with the quiz, I continued with tasks that I have mentioned in previous blogs.

This is the last lesson of the half term, so the last of the quiz. 

I think I have done well in completing this and personally I think it is good.

My target in to continue with my understanding of this type of code as we go into next half term for whatever we will be looking at them.

Note: The last couple of blogs have been fairly short because they have both been a continuation of a previous lesson as it has been one big all the work I have done is explained on "Lesson 5 Quiz Code".
