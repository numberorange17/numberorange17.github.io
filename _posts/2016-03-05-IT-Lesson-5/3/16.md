IT Lesson 5/3/16

Today I learned about what to do in certain situations that are really bad so we saw a video about this.

www:I think that I paid attention quite well because I had a long think about the video. This also lead me to making some decisions. Fortunately, I was on the good side of the class that did not choose to break the law in the video.

EBI: I think that this was a good  IT lesson and I think I could have made it better for myself if I made a few changes in my choices for the video questions.

I liked this IT lesson and I thought the website we had to look on for homework was good because It showed what to do if a situation like on the video occurred in real life and what to do.
