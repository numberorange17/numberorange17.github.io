Lesson 4 Conversations

Today, we continued with turtle, but instead of drawing coloured shapes or objects, we put in code so that it is if you're collaborating to a conversation with the computer, although anything the computer says is pre-planned. This was a good thing to do to help understanding coding in a better way. For example, we used code such as "if" , “else”, “print” and knowledge of using strings.

I think that I did well with this task as I made an operating conversation. This was the standard that was intended to be reached. Something else that would work, was using one answer to answer another question. This got a bit complicated in the end as it required a lot of work to do so.

I think I understood the lesson well and hope to continue understanding the work for next lesson. repl.it is definatly a good way to help knowledge of coding.
