IT Lesson 18/03/16

I think that todays lesson went well as we learned how to  use Prezi which is a website where you create websites.

WWW: I think that the things I did well were understanding what prezi was and I also worked out a lot of important tools that helped me create my big prezi presentation which I thought went well.

EBI : I think that it would have been a bit better if I would have logged on to prezi a bit quicker.

 

Other than that, the lesson went well.
