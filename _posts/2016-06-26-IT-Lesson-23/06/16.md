IT Lesson 23/06/16

Today we all carried on creating our micro-bit games. This caused a few problems that are hard to sort out.

WWW: I think that this Lesson as I only managed to get stuck at the end, this was good for me

EBI: I think that I should have not been stuck at the end. This would have made me more confident if it did not happen

Overall, Today was ok.
