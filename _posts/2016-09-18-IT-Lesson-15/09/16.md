IT Lesson 15/09/16

Today went well as we managed to do more than last lesson. We were doing exactly the same as last time which was putting together the computer and then coding it to repeat a message of our choice.

WWW: I think that I understood the code used and could redo it without instructions and I worked well with my partner.

EBI: Unfortunately it took us a while like last time to put the computer together and get it all working.

Overall I think that the lesson we had today went well.
