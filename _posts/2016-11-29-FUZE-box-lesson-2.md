</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I thought that managing to swap around on who reads and types the code and who checks is a good idea. We realised that it was really hard to see where to put the lights and you had to look carefully at the instructions. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? 
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that to improve my learning, we need to put the lights in the right sockets in time so we can work faster, this leads on to the fact we were slow. We only managed to complete the first exercise on the project 'Flashing lights' therefore getting  one light to light up and we saved our work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Because of our timing my target for next lesson would be to work quicker. We can do this by looking carefully at where we put the lights and complete more work in the time provided. I think I work well with my partner although he dropped a few of the lights.</td>
